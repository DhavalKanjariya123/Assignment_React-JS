<!-- How to change in components of React Js?

    
Changing components in React.js typically involves modifying the JSX code and potentially updating the component's state or props. Here's a general guide on how to make changes to React components:

Update JSX Code: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. To make changes to a component's structure or appearance, you'll need to modify the JSX code in the component's file. Locate the component's render method (or the return statement if you're using functional components) and make the necessary changes to the JSX.
